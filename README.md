### **ETV Process I - Critical Thinking Session 1**
**Total Project Duration Goal**: 2 hours  
**Time Spent So Far**: 20 minutes  
   - **10 mins**: Writing initial thoughts and project details.
   - **10 mins**: Refining approach and organization with AI assistance.

#### **1. Introduction & Purpose (5 mins)**
   - Clarify the goal: Create an R Shiny app to predict NFL game outcomes (win/loss) using various factors.
   - Introduce the ETv philosophy and its relevance to the project.

#### **2. Data Extraction (10 mins)**
   - Identify the data source: NFL Reference.
   - Discuss the features to extract:
     - Offensive metrics (e.g., total yards, touchdowns).
     - Defensive metrics (e.g., sacks, interceptions).
     - Special Teams performance.
     - Game outcome factors (e.g., final score, score difference).
   - Target response variable: Win/Loss.
   - Plan for handling data with potential inconsistencies (e.g., no ties).

#### **3. Data Transformation (25 mins)**
   - Discuss how to clean, preprocess, and structure the data.
   - Selection/creation of 15 key features for analysis (30 total variables including both teams).
     - Offensive, Defensive, Special Teams, and Game Outcome metrics.
   - Consider how to deal with data imbalance or outliers.
   - Prepare for feature engineering if necessary.

#### **4. Model Development (30 mins)**
   - Train/Test Split with percentage breakdown.
   - Set up k-fold cross-validation for model evaluation.
   - Discuss the use of Decision Trees as the primary visualization for model interpretation.
   - Consider using ROC curves for evaluating model performance.

#### **5. Visualization (20 mins)**
   - Focus on how to display Decision Tree and/or ROC curve.
   - Allow user interaction:
     - Select features for the model.
     - Adjust cross-validation parameters.
   - Make the visualization informative and interactive to help users understand the prediction model.

#### **6. Application Implementation (20 mins)**
   - Discuss GitHub version control:
     - Create a repo for the project.
     - Plan how to manage contributions and updates.
   - Structure the Shiny app for educational use in STAT 331.
   - Implement a user guide to explain the ETv process and its importance.

#### **7. Wrap-up & Next Steps (10 mins)**
   - Summarize key takeaways.
   - Outline tasks to be completed before the next session.
   - Identify any potential challenges or areas that need further exploration.
